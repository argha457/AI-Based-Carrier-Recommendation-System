AI-Based Course Recommendation System
This project is an AI-powered Course Recommendation System that helps users find the most suitable courses based on their interests and preferences. The system features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and employs machine learning techniques for accurate course recommendations.

Features
Interactive GUI: Built with Python's Tkinter library for a seamless user experience.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier for course prediction.
Customizable Preferences: Users can select their interests from various categories to receive personalized recommendations.
Data Training Module: Automatically trains or retrains the model using labeled datasets.
Categorized Features: Covers diverse categories such as Arts, Technology, Sciences, Medicine, Languages, and more.

Use the GUI to:

Select your interests from various categories.
Train the model by uploading a dataset (if needed).
View recommended courses based on your preferences.
To train the model with a new dataset, ensure the dataset is in CSV format and includes the required features.

Dataset Format
The dataset should include the following:

Features: Columns for user preferences such as 'Drawing,' 'Coding,' 'Sports,' etc.
Target Variable: A column named Courses containing course labels.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Tkinter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib
Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier
Data Handling: Label Encoding for feature preprocessing
